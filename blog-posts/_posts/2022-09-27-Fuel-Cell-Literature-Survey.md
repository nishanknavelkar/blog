## Task of the Non Technical Project

Fuel cell technology is an important pillar for the wider use of regenerative energy, i.e.
via intermediate storage as hydrogen. Replacing fossil fuel burning engines in automotive
applications with fuel cells and electrical engines is one of the most promising ways to
reduce local CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in the mobility and transport sector. Mathematical models
of fuel cells can be used to improve their optimal and safe operation in automotive
applications.

This work aims at providing an overview on the current state of the art of fuel cell
modeling in automotive applications on the system level, namely of the fuell cell stack
and peripheral components required for hydrogen supply, air supply, humidification, and
cooling. The focus is on identifying high quality publications, i.e. those with well justified
and documented models, and high quality active research groups.
The main objective of this work is literature analysis.
