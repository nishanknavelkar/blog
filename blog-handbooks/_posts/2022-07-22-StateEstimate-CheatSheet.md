## Cheat Sheet

### *Course Info*
#### Learning objectives and acquired competences:
The module provides an introduction to state estimation and model based measurement systems. The students are enabled to judge whether the available measurement data are sufficient to reconstruct all states of a process model, or which additional measurement information is required. At the end of the course the students are able to choose suitable state estimation techniques for linear and nonlinear systems. Special emphasis is on the Kalman filter. The students are enabled to derive the filter equations, to implement them and to choose the tuning parameters.

The acquired knowledge is deepened in computer exercises. In mini-projects, the
students obtain practical experience in programming and testing state estimation
algorithms.

#### Contents:
• Observability criteria for LTI systems
• Luenberger observers for LTI systems with one or several measurements
• Kalman filter for linear time-discrete systems
• Kalman filter for linear time-continuous systems
• Extended Kalman filter for nonlinear time-discrete and time-continous systems
• Unscented Kalman filter
• Kalman filter with constrained filter update
• Bayesian estimators
• Outlook on observers for nonlinear systems
