Fuel cell technology is an important pillar for the wider use of regenerative energy, i.e. via intermediate storage as hydrogen. Replacing fossil fuel burning engines in automotive applications with fuel cells and electrical engines is one of the most promising ways to reduce local CO2 emissions in the mobility and transport sector. Mathematical models of fuel cells can be used to improve their optimal and safe operation in automotive applications.

This work aims at providing an overview on the current state of the art of fuel cell modeling in automotive applications on the system level, namely of the fuell cell stack and peripheral components required for hydrogen supply, air supply, humidification, and cooling. The focus is on identifying high quality publications, i.e. those with well justified and documented models, and high quality active research groups. The main objective of this work is literature analysis.
